# Reminder 

This repository goal is to play with [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) and to be able to build a static website with markdown. 

Maybe you will be able to see interesting content one day.

## Build the project

You need to have node.js & npm installed. Then you just have to run :

```
npm install
make
```

And then you can see the static website in the **build/** folder.
